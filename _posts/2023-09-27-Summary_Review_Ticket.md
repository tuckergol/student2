### Summary of Task: Web Programming Basics

- Fulfilled requirements stated through hacks for each category/link
    - Ex: HTML Basics, JS Errors, JS Basics, etc...
- Addressed some Team Passion Project topics (current idea involves Geoguessr-type interactability) by including them in divs and paragraphs, primarily/firstly in HTML Basics hacks
- Aided teammates in ensuring their progress is correct (accoring to my knowledge)
    - Facilitated work habits and processes
