### PBL Unit 1 / Week 1
This week, I aim to do my Live Review on Thursday, finish tool setup, and continue setting up my Student Github Pages Blog.

Update: Live Review moved to Friday then delayed until week 2.

- Monday: Schedule Live Review and finish tool setup. Continue work on Student Blog.
- Tuesday: Use knowledge from Tech Talks to finish tool setup and continue working on Student Blog, updating the Home Page.
- Wednesday: Continue work on Home Page and select theme.
- Thursday: Original date for Live Review.
- Friday: Live Review delayed until week 2.


### Progress
> Current necessities for success in the class...
- Use Slack and collaborate with peers to resolve issues after failing to attempt to do so yourself
- Ensure all tools are installed and setup ready for use
- Student Blog's Home Page and theme should be tasks completed
