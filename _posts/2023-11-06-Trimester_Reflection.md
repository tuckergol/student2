# Reflection on topics/general things learned
- Learned how to manage, facilitate, and navigate tools/applications
    - Primarily VSCode and GitHub/GitHub Pages
- Through lessons (Team Teaches and Tech Talks), I learned many core learning targets for basic programming
    - Ex: Data, Lists, and Dictionaries, Libraries, Iterations, etc.
    - Did homework and classwork (Popcorn and Homework Hacks)
        - Also performed own Team Teach in Team: Algorithms (3.3-3.4)
- Learned about additional topics
    - Ex: Deployment (AWS), about APIs, etc.
        - Process regarding Passion Project
- Performed various "Live Reviews" throughout the Trimester, including a Tool Check and Team Test (1.1-1.4)

I hope to continue to develop my independent and collaborative programming, agile, and computer navigational abilities throughout future Trimesters.
