### Struggles of Week 2
- Confusion of what to do/I didn't have a 100% clear goal in mind that I was actively striving towards to complete
- Computer battery is worsening: posed some difficulties in the workspace

### Summary of Accomplishments of Week 2
- Began learning/experimenting with various functions of Python and Javascript
- Constructed weekly plans
- Created lab notebook ("Time Box") and added content to various rows/columns: Plans, Hacks, and Tangibles
- Played around with different games/utilities (Snake, Game of Life, Calculator)
- Finally pursued an opportunity to actually do Live Review #1 after being prepared for an extensive period of time beforehand
