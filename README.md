## About

This repository is a collection of various files that document the individual and reflective aspects of my computer science journey. I blog and learn here, specifically through utilities such as my Time Box, in which I highlight weekly Plans, Hacks,and Tangibles to better track my computer science journey.

## Work

- Blogging: I have blogged and created write-ups for various projects and events, such as Data Structures and N@tM, respectively.
- Learning: multiple times, I have used this repository to follow teacher lessons and learn interactively using Jupyter Notebook files.
