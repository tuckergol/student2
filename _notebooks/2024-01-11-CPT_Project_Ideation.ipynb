    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Project idea: \n",
    "    - Various organized features serve a purpose for those who are interested in events regarding astronomy\n",
    "        - Ex: features including moon phases, weather integration (in relation to stargazing), cosmic events like meteor showers or eclipses (include location and date/time), and dark sky locations\n",
    "    - Database\n",
    "        - Table to register login information\n",
    "            - Login info consists of Username, Password, Password Verification, Email\n",
    "            - Login’s role would be primarily to keep personalized settings\n",

    "- **Personalized formatting: settings**\n",
    "    - Themes (dark/light theme)\n",
    "        - Frontend; HTML/CSS/JS\n",
    "            - Local storage\n",
    "    - Ability to switch between fahrenheit/celsius for weather system(s)\n",
    "        - Perform calculations between fahrenheit/celsius\n",
    "            - (°F) - 32 * 5/9\n",
    "            - (°C) * 9/5 + 32\n",
    "            - Alternative option: utilize API endpoints that allow unit specification in API requests\n",

    "- **Calendar containing dates of cosmic events and moon phases**\n",
    "    - API integration\t\n",
    "        - Astronomy APIs provide data → make API requests to fetch data possibly w/ JS + Fetch\n",
    "    - Server-side periodic updates to refresh calendar data (moon phases weekly)\n",
    "    - Calendar Library usage\n",
    "        - JS calendar like FullCalendar could help integrating Library aspects\n",

    "- **Dynamic solar system planet (+ sun/moon) visibility hours (in relation to location)**\n",
    "    - API integration\n",
    "        - NASA's Solar System Dynamics Group API --> API key --> authentication --> fetch real time planet data\n",
    "            - Data displayed: illumination (%), hour when rising, hour when setting\n",
    "            - Time zone compensation (dynamic clock hours displayed in table)\n",
    "        - Geocoding API --> categorize city entered in settings to broader location (time zone)\n",
    "            - Recalculate dynamic hours displayed in table on page\n",

    "- **Night sky visibility (use location)**\n",
    "    - Usage of Geolocation API w/ JS → retrieve city → provide sky data based on general location (ex: San Diego area)\n",
    "        - Denying access would result in the user being unable to use this feature\n",
    "            - Redirection to fail screen or home page (likely following a warning/error message)\n",
    "    - API usage; geolocation data → customize API requests, retrieve visibility info\n",
    "- **Weather integration, meteorological data (API)**\n",
    "    - API usage most likely sourced from The National Weather Service’s real time APIs\n",
    "        - Relevant parameters, primarily the user’s location, will be registered\n",
    "            - If location info is unavailable, users will be denied access to this feature similarly to the visibility feature\n",
    "    - Parse JSON (client request → server) response from weather API → extract + display data on user interface\n",
    "    - Additional ideas could involve displaying real-time space weather data, including solar activity, aurora forecasts, and geomagnetic conditions\n",
