    "# What went well:\n",
    "I am significantly more confident in other computer science term/knowledge-based questions, as not only are those questions more intuitive-based, but I also have been learning those more recently through this Trimester's Team Teaches. So I think I did well for the most part regaring those questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What could have gone better:\n",
    "I feel that I am most in need of improving with the questions that involve code of some kind. I am less confident with these coding questions, as I've generally had signficantly less experience in that field, compared to essential computer science knowledge especially. Most coding I do involves side-by-side research and learning from sources such as Khanacademy or even ChatGPT.\n",

    "I plan to practice the exam and extend my knowledge further by studying this test's results more, continuing AP CSP studies, and researching and practicing more of this content online through various sources (ex: watching YouTube videos about the exam content)."
