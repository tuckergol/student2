    "## Jinja 2 Overview\n",
    "- Jinja2 is a templating engine for Python.\n",
    "- Widely used in web development frameworks like Flask and Django.\n",
    "- Supports template inheritance for creating modular and reusable code.\n",
    "- Provides flexible syntax for embedding Python-like expressions in templates.\n",
    "- Offers built-in filters for data manipulation and formatting.\n",
    "- Supports control structures like loops and conditionals.\n",
    "- Automatically escapes HTML characters by default, enhancing web application security.\n",

    "# Summary and Purpose\n",
    "- Database Environment Setup: It ensures that the necessary environment variables are set to facilitate the Flask application's operation.\n",
    "- Dependency Checks: It checks if essential dependencies (sqlite3, python3, and Flask) are installed on the system. This helps ensure that the script can run successfully.\n",
    "- Flask Migration Initialization: If the migrations directory doesn't exist, it initializes Flask database migrations. This is a crucial step in managing database schema changes over time.\n",
    "- Database Backup and Restore: It handles scenarios where the main database (sqlite.db) may need to be restored from a backup (sqlite-backup.db) before migration. This ensures data integrity during the migration process.\n",
    "- Database Migration: It performs database migrations using Flask's migration commands. This step is essential for applying schema changes and updates to the database structure.\n",
    "- Data Generation: Finally, it executes a custom command (generate_data) to generate additional data, which can be useful for testing or initializing the application with some starting data."
