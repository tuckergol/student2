    "# Binary Logic Ideation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compilation of various binary-related and sourced activites\n",
    "  - Similar to CoolMathGames, but 3 games and solely binary-related\n",
    "        - Binary Checkers\n",

    "## Binary Checkers\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Checkers is a binary-themed version of the classic Checkers game. Players move binary pieces on a checkerboard, capturing opponent pieces by jumping over them and converting them to binary 1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a checkerboard grid and represent the pieces with binary values (0 and 1).\n",
    "- Implement the rules of movement and capturing for binary checkers.\n",
    "- Develop an interactive game interface, allowing users to make moves by clicking on the squares.\n",
    "- Incorporate logic to detect and execute binary conversions when a piece is captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/alaraipek/Issues/assets/115954616/507125d6-cf4d-4329-94dd-d22a45fe11c9\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Blue vs. Red Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Binary Red/Blue game, users interact with a grid of red and blue squares. When a square is clicked, its binary value and the values of neighboring squares change. The objective is to make all squares the same color by manipulating their binary states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a grid structure and represent colors with binary values (0 for red, 1 for blue).\n",
    "- Implement logic to update the binary values of clicked squares and their neighbors.\n",
    "- Develop an interactive interface for users to click on squares and observe color changes.\n",
    "- Include a win condition check to determine when all squares are the same color.\n",
    "- Add visual effects and animations to enhance the gaming experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/alaraipek/Issues/assets/115954616/666fa8b3-98e3-42c5-a24e-135dce33bd6d\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Sudoku\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binary Sudoku game is a unique twist on the classic Sudoku, where instead of using numbers 1-9, players use binary digits 0 and 1. The challenge is to fill a 3x3 grid within each larger 9x9 grid, ensuring that each row and column adds up to 3 in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a 9x9 grid structure for the Sudoku board.\n",
    "- Implement logic to generate a solvable binary Sudoku puzzle.\n",
    "- Provide an interactive interface for users to input their binary values.\n",
    "- Develop a validation system to check if the entered values satisfy the binary Sudoku rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/alaraipek/Issues/assets/115954616/a823cadb-7f4a-46c2-b4cf-2735726385c0\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Score Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binary Score Tracker is a tool to keep track of users' scores and achievements using the binary system. Users earn binary points, and their overall score is displayed in binary format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a user profile system to store scores and achievements.\n",
    "- Represent scores and achievements using binary numbers.\n",
    "- Implement a scoring mechanism that converts traditional scores into binary.\n",
    "- Display the user's overall score in binary format on their profile.\n",
    "- Include features such as score history, achievements, and leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Graders: Nitin, Ishan, Akshay, Saatvik\n",
    "Score: 0.95/1.00\n",
    "- Good ideation and concept ideas, improve on detail and whole binary aspect."
